## ESTIMATION GUIDE

**Story Points Scale** (Fibonacci):
- 1 point: Simple task, < 2 hours (e.g., add a field to model)
- 2 points: Small task, 2-4 hours (e.g., create simple endpoint)
- 3 points: Medium task, 4-8 hours (e.g., create CRUD controller)
- 5 points: Large task, 1-2 days (e.g., complete feature with tests)
- 8 points: Very large task, 2-3 days (e.g., complex feature)
- 13 points: Huge task, 3-5 days (e.g., major feature with multiple components)
- 21 points: Epic-level task, 1-2 weeks (e.g., complete use case)
- 34 points: Multi-week effort (should be broken down)

**Sprint Capacity**: 34-55 story points per 2-week sprint (assuming 2-3 developers)

## PRIORITY LABELS

- **P0 - Critical**: Blocks production, security issues, data loss
- **P1 - High**: Core features, major bugs, user impact
- **P2 - Medium**: Important features, minor bugs, nice-to-have
- **P3 - Low**: Future enhancements, technical debt, optimizations

## ISSUE TYPES IN JIRA

- **Epic**: Large body of work (e.g., "Messaging System")
- **Story**: User-facing feature (e.g., "As a user, I want to...")
- **Task**: Development work (e.g., "Create Message model")
- **Bug**: Something broken (e.g., "Login fails on mobile")
- **Subtask**: Breakdown of story/task
